      <title>2018: KickOff Meeting!</title>

      <description>On a cool Monday evening in late July almost 40 women (and a few brave men) gathered at Michigan State University&amp;rsquo;s campus to kickoff the R-Ladies East Lansing Chapter. The group included women in industry and academia who were using the R-language (or planning to use it) for a variety of applications including computer science, human health, earth sciences, political science, statistics and finance.
Over pizza and pop the group warmed up with introductions and engaged in discussions about their R-interests.</description>

      <description>Welcome to our new chapter!  What weâ€™re about R-Ladies East Lansing is a local chapter of R-Ladies Global. We meet to discuss, learn, teach, present, work on all things R! Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. The group exists to promote gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities.</description>
