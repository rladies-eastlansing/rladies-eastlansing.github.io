A series of R and data science lightning talks has been scheduled for August and September for members to share how they are using R in their work or for fun. Attendees were overwhelming interested in learning more about data visualization, R Markdown and WebApps with Shiny and the group hopes to host a few workshops to address these topics in the future.\nR-Ladies East Lansing supports leadership by women and other gender minorities and welcomes women and men to participate by leading an r-specific discussion over slack and in the bi-weekly Fall R-Ladies discussions (2nd and 4th Mondays) on MSU\u0026rsquo;s campus.
